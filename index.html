		<h4>Stephen Hawking - A Brief History of Time</h4>
		Told in language we all can understand, A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and &ldquo;arrows of time,&rdquo; of the big bang and a bigger God&mdash;where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation.</div>

		<h4>Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow - The Grand Design</h4>
		When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent &ldquo;grand design&rdquo; of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion&mdash;or does science offer another explanation? In this startling and lavishly illustrated book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity.</div>

		<h4>Relativity: The Special and General Theory</h4>
		From the age of Galileo until the early years of the 20th century, scientists grappled with seemingly insurmountable paradoxes inherent in the theories of classical physics. With the publication of Albert Einstein's "special" and "general" theories of relativity, however, traditional approaches to solving the riddles of space and time crumbled. In their place stood a radically new view of the physical world, providing answers to many of the unsolved mysteries of pre-Einsteinian physics. Acclaimed as the pinnacle of scientific philosophy, the theories of relativity tend to be regarded as the exclusive domain of highly trained scientific minds. The great physicist himself disclaimed this exclusionary view, and in this book, he explains both theories in their simplest and most intelligible form for the layman not versed in the mathematical foundations of theoretical physics. In addition to the theories themselves, this book contains a final part presenting fascinating considerations on the universe as a whole.</div>

		<h4>Riwan Virk - The Simulation Hypothesis: An MIT Computer Scientist Shows Why AI, Quantum Physics and Eastern Mystics All Agree We Are In a Video Game</h4>
		The Simulation Hypothesis, by best-selling author, renowned MIT computer scientist and Silicon Valley video game designer Rizwan Virk, explains one of the most daring and consequential theories of our time. Drawing from research and concepts from computer science, artificial intelligence, video games, quantum physics, and referencing both speculative fiction and ancient eastern spiritual texts, Virk shows how all of these traditions come together to point to the idea that we may be inside a simulated reality like the Matrix.</div>

		<h4>Nicholas Carr - The Glass Cage: How Our Computers Are Changing Us</h4>
		In The Glass Cage, best-selling author Nicholas Carr digs behind the headlines about factory robots and self-driving cars, wearable computers and digitized medicine, as he explores the hidden costs of granting software dominion over our work and our leisure. Even as they bring ease to our lives, these programs are stealing something essential from us. Drawing on psychological and neurological studies that underscore how tightly people&rsquo;s happiness and satisfaction are tied to performing hard work in the real world, Carr reveals something we already suspect: shifting our attention to computer screens can leave us disengaged and discontented.</div>
